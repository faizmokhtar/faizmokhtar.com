I've been using zsh with antigen as the package manager for years. Over time as I add more customizations, I noticed that my shell startup time has become slow. Sometimes, it would took more than 3 seconds to start up.

I read few months (or a year) ago that nvm, a version manager for NodeJS can cause this issue so I thought maybe it's the right time I should try asdf.
