There's now a native support for Swift Package Manager that comes with the latest Xcode 11.

To add a new package is really easy. Go to:

```
File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...
```

and simply add the repository URL. For example, to add Alamofire library you just have to add `https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git`
