Similar like [Cocoapods][1] or [Carthage][2], you can use [Swift Package Manager][3] to manage the dependencies in your Cocoa project.

With the latest Xcode 11, there is now a native support for Swift Package Manager that you can use for your project.

## Adding a new package

To add a new package is really easy. Go to:

```
File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...
```

and add the package's repository URL. That's it. For example, to add [Alamofire][4] library you just have to add `https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git`

![Add new Swift package in your project](/images/uploads/swiftpm-1.png "Add new Swift package")

You then will have the option to configure the package based on the version, branch or even commit.

![Set the Swift package rules](/images/uploads/swiftpm-2.png "Set the Swift package rules")

Once you have chosen package target, you'll noticed the newly added package at the bottom of Xcode's Project Navigator. Now you can `import` the package as usual

## Removing a package

To remove a package is easy too. Navigate to your project settings and you will noticed that there's a new section called Swift Packages. Navigate to it, click on your library and click on the minus button below to remove it.

## Caveats

From my limited understanding of how it works, I was expecting Swift Package Manager will create a `Package.swift` file but instead it creates a references of the package in `.xcodeproj` file.

![git diff for the xcodeproj](/images/uploads/swiftpm-5.png "`git diff` for the xcodeproj")

Based on my experience of how painful it is to solve a merge conflict in `.xcodeproj` file, this is definitely something that I probably would think twice before using it in a team project. Otherwise, using Swift Package Manager is really easy. Hey, no `rubygems` dependencies is already a plus! ðŸ˜‰
