I made a thing! An iOS app to remotely manage Gitlab runners. I wrote this app to solve one of the pain points that I frequently face back when I managed the CI machine that hosted Gitlab runners for my teams.

My coworkers frequently asked me to check why their pipelines or runners were failing and so in a begrudging manner I would [VNC'd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) into the machine and checked them.

This app solved these problems by providing easy access for me 

* to quickly check the runners status
* pause, resume, or delete a runner remotely

Oh did I mentioned that this is my first SwiftUI and paid app? SwiftUI is really fun to write but there are some weird bugs that Apple needs to fix still.

Anyway, it's available now on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/my/app/runners-manage-gitlab-runner/id1547639220) for the price of **US$1.99** or **MYR 7.90**. Do check it out!
