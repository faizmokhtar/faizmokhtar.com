Here are some helpful keyboard shortcuts that can help you run your unit tests much more quickly

- To run all tests:

<kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> 

- To run whichever test your text caret (those blinking thing) is  currently in:

> <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd>

- To run the last test that you have ran:

> <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>
