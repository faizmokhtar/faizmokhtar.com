Hi, My name is **Faiz Mokhtar**. I am a **software engineer** who is currently based in **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia**. I dabbled mostly in mobile development; Objective-C, Swift and React Native.Aside from that, I am knowledgeable in mobile CI/CD. Currently I am learning [Go](https://golang.org/) and loving it.
