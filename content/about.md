Hi, I'm **Faiz** -- A **software engineer** based in **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia** ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾. I dabbled mostly in mobile development; Objective-C, Swift and React Native.Aside from the usual development, I am knowledgeable in mobile CI/CD. Currently I am learning [Go](https://golang.org/) and loving it.

On this blog I will share my working processes, tip and tricks, tools and problems I found along the way.

In the internet, you can usually find me:

- Pushing codes on [Github][2]
- RT'ing and ranting about codes at [@faizmokh][1]
- Showcasing my half-ass design on [Dribbble][3]
- Asking questions on [Stack Overflow][4]
- Trying to look professional on [LinkedIn][5]
- Occasionally lurking on [Hacker News][6]
- Making things at [Product Hunt][7]
- Tracking my reading habits on [Goodreads][8]
- Quantifying my life on [gyrosco.pe][9]
