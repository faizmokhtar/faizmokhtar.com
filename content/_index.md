Hi, I'm **Faiz** -- A **software engineer** based in **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia** ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾. I dabbled mostly in mobile development; Objective-C, Swift and React Native.Aside from the usual development, I am knowledgeable in mobile CI/CD. Currently I am learning [Go](https://golang.org/) and loving it.

On this blog I will share my working processes, tip and tricks, tools and problems I found along the way.
